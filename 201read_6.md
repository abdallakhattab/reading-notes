### Chapter 5: Document Object Model

The Document Object Model (DOM) specifies how browsers should create a model of an HTML page and how JavaScript can access and update the contents of a web page while it is in the browser window.

The browser represents the page using a DOM tree.
DOM trees have four types of nodes: document nodes, element nodes, attribute nodes, and text nodes.
You can select element nodes by their id or class attributes, by tag name, or using CSS selector syntax.
Whenever a DOM query can return more than one node, it will always return a Nadel ist.

From an element node, you can access and update its content using properties such as textContent and Inner HTML or using DOM manipulation techniques.
An element node can contain multiple text nodes and child elements that are siblings of each other.
In older browsers, implementation of the DOM is inconsistent (and is a popular reason for using jQuery).
Browsers offer tools for viewing the DOM tree.
