## Chapter 10 : Introducing CSS

CSS allows you to create rules that specify how the content of an element should appear

CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule contains two parts: a selector and a declaration

CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two parts: a property and a value, separated by a colon.

important: each separated by a semi-colon.

you can add CSS externally by the link tag or internally by the style tag

to select the section that you want to apply CSS on it you must use the selectors

such as: id, class, etc.
